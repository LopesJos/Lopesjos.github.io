On this project the goal was to predict if a bank client would say yes or no to a new campaign offer proposed by the bank. This was a group project, in which we used python and some of its libraries, the most important libraries where pandas, skl-learn and streamlit.

On this project the goal was to predict if whether a constructor work has positive or negative cost. This was a solo project, in which I used python and some of its libraries, the most important libraries where pandas, skl-learn and streamlit, similar to my other machine learning project.
